# The parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE

The PACIAE model is a multipurpose Monte Carlo event generator developed to describe a wide range of collisions, including hadron-hadron interactions, hadron interactions off nuclei, and nucleus-nucleus collisions. It is built based on PYTHIA-6.4 and incorporates parton and hadron rescattering stages to take care of the nuclear medium effects.

## Install
Just install the file and decompress it. Then you can get the PACIAE source code directly.


## Usage

We encourage users to run the program on LINUX.
There are two ways to run the program.
 1. Use the normal compiler to complie the soruce code and run the PACIAE program. Take gfortran on LINUX as an example:
    - Compile and link the programs by the command:
        ```
            gfortran -O -C *.f -o paciae.x
        ```
    - Modify the input file of usu.dat according to your wish.
    - Run the program by the command:
        ```
            time ./paciae.x
        ```
      One could use the following command to run the program to in the background and record the log information.
        ```
            nohup time ./paciae.x > paciae.log &
        ```
 2. Use the PACIAE.sh shell-script to compile the code, generate usu.dat file and run program automatically.
    - Modify the PACIAE.sh file as needed.
    - Give executable permission to the PACIAE.sh file by command:
        ```
            chmod +x PACIAE.sh
        ```
    - Run the PACIAE.sh script by the command:
        ```
            time ./PACIAE.sh
        ```
         The more recommended command is:
         ```
            time ./PACIAE.sh | tee $(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S").log
         ``` 
         which records the screen information to a log file with date and time.
         Of course, one could run it in the background:
         ```
            nohup time ./PACIAE.sh | tee $(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S").log &
         ```
    It is also worth mentioning that tasks can be submitted to computer clusters and supercomputers using the PACIAE.sh script. (It is currently only available in SLRUM and LSF scheduling systems) More detailed information and usage please read the PACIAE.sh file.
